    // 1. What is Asynchronous Streams !
    // Async Stream is a stream of async data, which we can look through, to access it using an await keyword
    // in async we await on a function ... in async stream we await on a foreach loop ~
    // async always returns a single, scalar value ... async stream is a collection

    // 2. Difference between Async Stream and Reactive Extensions !
    // Async Stream is a pull mechanism, Reactive Extensions => push, we subscribe to a stream and when data is available we get a callback
